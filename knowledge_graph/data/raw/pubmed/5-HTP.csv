40944161,The Impact of 5-Hydroxytryptophan Supplementation on Cognitive Function and Mood in Singapore Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Objectives: Concurrent with global aging epidemics, cognitive decline has become an increasing public health concern. Dietary supplementation may offer neuroprotective benefits, and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) has gained interest due to its role in serotonin synthesis, thereby regulating cognitive function and mood. However, there is limited evidence on its effect on cognitive function, especially among older Asian adults. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the effects of 5-HTP supplement...",Nutrients,2025-Aug
40141108,Effects of Lactococcus cremoris PS133 in 5-Hydroxytryptophan-Induced Irritable Bowel Syndrome Model Rats.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder marked by abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits. Recently, more and more evidence supports gut microbiota imbalance in IBS and highlights the potential of probiotics in restoring gut health and reducing symptoms. In this study, we explored the effects of Lactococcus cremoris PS133 (PS133) on an IBS-like condition in rats triggered by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a serotonin precursor. Eight-week-old Sprague Dawley rats ...",International journal of molecular sciences,2025-Mar
40113000,Directed evolution of hydroxylase XcP4H for enhanced 5-HTP production in engineered probiotics to treat depression.,"Depression exhibits a complex and multifaceted pathophysiology, accompanied by high rates of relapse and disability with current medication treatments. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a promising candidate for depression therapy, but its poor pharmacokinetics hinders its clinical application. To address this limitation, we introduced the hydroxylase XcP4H into Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to biosynthesize 5-HTP in vivo. To create a high-yielding EcN strain for 5-HTP production, we engineere...",International journal of biological macromolecules,2025-May
39488100,Prebiotic inulin alleviates anxiety and depression-like behavior in alcohol withdrawal mice by modulating the gut microbiota and 5-HT metabolism.,"Alcohol dependence (AD) is a common psychiatric disorder, often accompanied by anxiety and depression. These comorbidities are linked to disturbances in serotonin (5-HT) metabolism and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Clinical studies suggest that inulin, a prebiotic, can alleviate anxiety and depression in AD patients by affecting the gut microbiota, although the mechanisms remain unclear.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2024-Dec
39311539,Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus KY16 Improves Depression by Promoting Intestinal Secretion of 5-HTP and Altering the Gut Microbiota.,Increasing research suggests a connection between gut microbiota and depressive disorders. Targeted changes to the intestinal flora may contribute to alleviating anxiety and depression. This study aimed to identify probiotics that could attenuate stress-induced abnormal behavior and explore potential mechanisms. The administration of LR.KY16 significantly reduced stress-induced abnormal behaviors and physiological dysfunction. The mechanism may be via regulating the structure of the intestinal m...,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024-Oct
38899520,Lactobacillus plantarum AR495 improves colonic transport hyperactivity in irritable bowel syndrome through tryptophan metabolism.,"Lactobacillus plantarum AR495 is a widely used probiotic for the treatment of various digestive diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the specific mechanisms of L. plantarum AR495 in alleviating IBS remain unclear. Abnormal intestinal tryptophan metabolism can cause disordered immune responses, gastrointestinal peristalsis, digestion and sensation, which is closely related to IBS pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of L. plantarum A...",Food & function,2024-Jul
38835767,"Dietary 5-hydroxytryptophan improves sheep growth performance by enhancing ruminal functions, antioxidant capacity, and tryptophan metabolism: in vitro and in vivo studies.","Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) can regulate the synthesis of 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and melatonin (MT). In a previous metabolome analysis, we found that 5-HTP is an effective ingredient in yeast culture for regulating rumen fermentation. However, research on the effect of this microbial product (5-HTP) as a functional feed additive in sheep production is still not well explained. Therefore, this study examined the effects of 5-HTP on sheep rumen function and growth performance using in vitro and ...",Frontiers in immunology,2024
38537751,Mixed probiotics reduce the severity of stress-induced depressive-like behaviors.,"In recent years, the gut microbiome has gained significant attention in the spheres of research and public health. As a result, studies have increasingly explored the potential of probiotic dietary supplements as treatment interventions for conditions such as anxiety and depression. The present study examined the effect of mixed probiotics (Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and Enterococcus faecium) on inflammation, microbiome composition, and depressive-like behaviors in a macaque monkey model. The ...",Journal of affective disorders,2024-Jun
36377577,Ingestion of Lactobacillus helveticus WHH1889 improves depressive and anxiety symptoms induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress in mice.,"Emerging evidence indicates that the alterations in the gut microbiota-brain axis (GBA), which is the bilateral connection between the gut microbial communities and brain function, are involved in several mental illnesses, including depression. Certain probiotic strains have been revealed to improve depressive behaviours and the dysregulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism in depression. Here we evaluated the potential antidepressant effects of Lactobacillus helveticus strains using an...",Beneficial microbes,2022-Dec
35006225,Oral administration of Lactococcus lactis WHH2078 alleviates depressive and anxiety symptoms in mice with induced chronic stress.,"Depression is a mood disorder with a high prevalence rate globally, which is associated with abnormalities in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism. Emerging evidence suggests that certain probiotics that modulate 5-HT metabolism confer beneficial effects on depression. In this study, in vitro enterochromaffin RIN14B cells were used for screening potential antidepressant probiotic Lactococcus lactis strains. The L. lactis strain WHH2078 increased to high levels the 5-HT precursor 5-hydroxytrypto...",Food & function,2022-Jan

29102139,Short communication: Supplementation of colostrum and milk with 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan affects immune factors but not growth performance in newborn calves.,"In ruminants, colostrum is the main source of immunoglobulins for the newborn animal, conferring immune protection until the immune system becomes active and able to synthesize its own immunoglobulins. Serotonin (5-HT), a biogenic amine derived from tryptophan, has stimulatory effects on many physiological processes, including components of the innate (mastocytes, eosinophils, and natural killer cells) and adaptive (T and B lymphocytes) immune systems. Based on the known effects of 5-HT on the i...",Journal of dairy science,2018-Jan
