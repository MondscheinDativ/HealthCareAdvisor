38788832,Acute manganese toxicosis related to joint health supplement ingestion in two dogs.,"Two unrelated dogs residing in the same house including an 11-year-old, female spayed, mixed breed dog and a 7-year-old, female spayed, mixed breed dog ingested approximately 75 capsules of a human joint health supplement (Ligaplex I; Standard Process, WI, USA). A total of 2,062 mg of manganese was ingested between both dogs. Dog 1 developed acute fulminant liver failure and a severe coagulopathy that led to hepatic fractures and exsanguination from hemoabdomen. The estimated maximum time from i...",Topics in companion animal medicine,2024
34174886,"Effects of silybin supplementation on nutrient digestibility, hematological parameters, liver function indices, and liver-specific mi-RNA concentration in dogs.","Hepatopathies are an important group of disorders in dogs where proper nutritional care is crucial. Supplementation with a hepatoprotectant like silybin can improve liver function and should not interfere with nutrient digestibility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of both pure silybin and commercial hepatoprotectant on nutrients digestibility, liver function indices and health status in healthy dogs (EXP1). Moreover, the second experiment (EXP2) investigated the effect o...",BMC veterinary research,2021-Jun
33964619,A multi-analytical strategy for evaluation of quality and authenticity of artichoke food supplements for overweight control.,"Despite the widespread use of artichoke-based food supplements for obesity control (FSOC), studies on evaluation of the quality/authenticity of these commercial products are scarce. To that aim, a new multi-analytical strategy, based on the use of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-UV-MS), in combination with chemometrics, has been developed. Twenty-one artichoke FSOC and ...",Journal of chromatography. A,2021-Jun
33636349,Current innovations in nutraceuticals and functional foods for intervention of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,"As innovations in global agricultural production and food trading systems lead to major dietary shifts, high morbidity rates from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), accompanied by elevated risk of lipid metabolism-related complications, has emerged as a growing problem worldwide. Treatment and prevention of NAFLD and chronic liver disease depends on the availability of safe, effective, and diverse therapeutic agents, the development of which is urgently needed. Supported by a growing bod...",Pharmacological research,2021-Apr
33302488,Presence of Mycotoxins in Milk Thistle (Silybum marianum) Food Supplements: A Review.,"The consumption of herbal-based supplements, which are believed to have beneficial effects on human health with no side effects, has become popular around the world and this trend is still increasing. Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn, commonly known as milk thistle (MT), is the most commonly studied herb associated with the treatment of liver diseases. The hepatoprotective effects of active substances in silymarin, with silybin being the main compound, have been demonstrated in many studies. However...",Toxins,2020-Dec
30080294,"Milk thistle (Silybum marianum): A concise overview on its chemistry, pharmacological, and nutraceutical uses in liver diseases.","Milk thistle (MT; Silybum marianum), a member of the Asteraceae family, is a therapeutic herb with a 2,000-year history of use. MT fruits contain a mixture of flavonolignans collectively known as silymarin, being silybin (also named silibinin) the main component. This article reviews the chemistry of MT, the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, the pharmacologically relevant actions for liver diseases (e.g., anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, antifibrotic, antioxidant, and liver-regenerating ...",Phytotherapy research : PTR,2018-Nov

28629389,Cancer chemoprevention through dietary flavonoids: what's limiting?,"Flavonoids are polyphenols that are found in numerous edible plant species. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that specific flavonoids are chemo-preventive and cytotoxic against various cancers via a multitude of mechanisms. However, the clinical use of flavonoids is limited due to challenges associated with their effective use, including (1) the isolation and purification of flavonoids from their natural resources; (2) demonstration of the effects of flavonoids in redu...",Chinese journal of cancer,2017-Jun
27925249,Inhibition of glucuronidation and oxidative metabolism of buprenorphine using GRAS compounds or dietary constituents/supplements: in vitro proof of concept.,"The present study investigated the potential of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) compounds or dietary substances to inhibit the presystemic metabolism of buprenorphine and to increase its oral bioavailability. Using IVIVE, buprenorphine extraction ratios in intestine and liver were predicted as 96% and 71%, respectively. In addition, the relative fraction of buprenorphine metabolized by oxidation and glucuronidation in these two organs was estimated using pooled human intestinal and liver mic...",Biopharmaceutics & drug disposition,2017-Mar
27915198,A new approach to the rapid separation of isomeric compounds in a Silybum marianum extract using UHPLC core-shell column with F5 stationary phase.,"In this paper, a new ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) method using a core-shell column with a pentafluorophenyl stationary phase for separation of seven active compounds of a Silybum marianum extract was developed and validated. Silymarin, an extract of Silybum marianum, is known for its abilities to protect the liver from toxic substances, hepatitis therapy, and anti-tumour activity. Silymarin is currently being widely used in commercial preparations and herbal teas. Separat...",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2017-Feb
26087767,Hepatopathy following consumption of a commercially available blue-green algae dietary supplement in a dog.,"Dietary supplement use in both human and animals to augment overall health continues to increase and represents a potential health risk due to the lack of safety regulations imposed on the manufacturers. Because there are no requirements for demonstrating safety and efficacy prior to marketing, dietary supplements may contain potentially toxic contaminants such as hepatotoxic microcystins produced by several species of blue-green algae.",BMC veterinary research,2015-Jun
