40507126,Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Supplementation to Alleviate Heart Failure: A Mitochondrial Dysfunction Perspective.,"Heart failure represents the terminal stage in the development of many cardiovascular diseases, and its pathological mechanisms are closely related to disturbances in energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. In recent years, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a core coenzyme involved in cellular energy metabolism and redox homeostasis, has been shown to potentially ameliorate heart failure through the regulation of mitochondrial function. This review systematical...",Nutrients,2025-May
40243481,Enhancement of NK Cell Cytotoxic Activity and Immunoregulatory Effects of a Natural Product Supplement Across a Wide Age Span: A 30-Day In Vivo Human Study.,"The purpose of this study was to examine whether supplementation of ultra- and nanofiltered colostrum-based products, combined with egg yolk extract, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), quercetin, alpha-ketoglutarate, white button mushroom, and celery seed extracts (the formula was patented by 4Life Research Company, USA and named as AgePro), modulate the functional activity of natural killer (NK) cells in vivo. We found that this supplement, taken orally in two capsules twice a day for 30 days, ...",International journal of molecular sciences,2025-Mar
39037560,NMN Synbiotics: A Multifaceted Therapeutic Approach for Alzheimer's Disease.,"With the aging global population, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a significant social and economic burden, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) synbiotics, a combination of NMN, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum CGMCC 1.16089, and lactulose, in mitigating AD pathology. APP/PS1 mice were supplemented with NMN synbiotics and compared against control groups. The effects on amyloid-β (Aβ...",Neurochemical research,2024-Oct
38924882,NMN synbiotics intervention modulates gut microbiota and metabolism in APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease mouse models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition with growing evidence implicating the gut microbiota in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of NMN synbiotics, a combination of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), Lactobacillus plantarum, and lactulose, on the gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Results demonstrated that NMN synbiotics led to a notable restructuring of the gut microbiota, with a decreased Firmic...",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2024-Sep
38340651,The therapeutic perspective of NAD+ precursors in age-related diseases.,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is the fundamental molecule that performs numerous biological reactions and is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Studies have found that NAD+ decreases with age in certain tissues, and age-related NAD+ depletion affects physiological functions and contributes to various aging-related diseases. Supplementation of NAD+ precursor significantly elevates NAD+ levels in murine tissues, effectively mitigates metabolic syndrome, enhances cardiovascula...",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2024-Apr
34238308,"Nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation enhances aerobic capacity in amateur runners: a randomized, double-blind study.","Recent studies in rodents indicate that a combination of exercise training and supplementation with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursors has synergistic effects. However, there are currently no human clinical trials analyzing this.",Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition,2021-Jul
33888596,Nicotinamide mononucleotide increases muscle insulin sensitivity in prediabetic women.,"In rodents, obesity and aging impair nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis, which contributes to metabolic dysfunction. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) availability is a rate-limiting factor in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis. We conducted a 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the effect of NMN supplementation on metabolic function in postmenopausal women with prediabetes who were overweight or obese. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, assessed...","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2021-Jun
31463647,"Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation promotes anti-aging miRNA expression profile in the aorta of aged mice, predicting epigenetic rejuvenation and anti-atherogenic effects.","Understanding molecular mechanisms involved in vascular aging is essential to develop novel interventional strategies for treatment and prevention of age-related vascular pathologies. Recent studies provide critical evidence that vascular aging is characterized by NAD+ depletion. Importantly, in aged mice, restoration of cellular NAD+ levels by treatment with the NAD+ booster nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) exerts significant vasoprotective effects, improving endothelium-dependent vasodilation...",GeroScience,2019-Aug
31015147,Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation rescues cerebromicrovascular endothelial function and neurovascular coupling responses and improves cognitive function in aged mice.,"Adjustment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to neuronal activity via neurovascular coupling (NVC) has an essential role in maintenance of healthy cognitive function. In aging increased oxidative stress and cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction impair NVC, contributing to cognitive decline. There is increasing evidence showing that a decrease in NAD+ availability with age plays a critical role in a range of age-related cellular impairments but its role in impaired NVC responses remains unexplo...",Redox biology,2019-Jun
29118320,Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation ameliorates the impact of maternal obesity in mice: comparison with exercise.,"Maternal overnutrition increases the risk of long-term metabolic dysfunction in offspring. Exercise improves metabolism partly by upregulating mitochondrial biogenesis or function, via increased levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). We have shown that the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) can reverse some of the negative consequences of high fat diet (HFD) consumption. To investigate whether NMN can impact developmentally-set metabolic deficits, we compared treadmil...",Scientific reports,2017-Nov
26970090,Nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation reverses vascular dysfunction and oxidative stress with aging in mice.,"We tested the hypothesis that supplementation of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD(+) intermediate, increases arterial SIRT1 activity and reverses age-associated arterial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Old control mice (OC) had impaired carotid artery endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) (60 ± 5% vs. 84 ± 2%), a measure of endothelial function, and nitric oxide (NO)-mediated EDD (37 ± 4% vs. 66 ± 6%), compared with young mice (YC). This age-associated impairment in EDD was restored...",Aging cell,2016-Jun
